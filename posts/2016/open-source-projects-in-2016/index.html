<h2 id="tocbot"><a href="#tocbot" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Tocbot</h2>
<p><a href="http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/">Tocbot</a> was first created on 3/22/2016. The idea for it came to me when I wanted a table of contents with jump links for navigating long pages with a lot of text. I found a library called <a href="http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js/">Tocify</a> that worked and basically did what I wanted, but I didn't like that it had dependencies on jQuery AND jQuery UI which are huge, and it was also no longer actively maintained; so I decided to write my own library with no jQuery dependencies that used native DOM methods instead. The result is Tocbot, which is currently used on <a href="https://developers.optimizely.com/x/solutions/javascript/reference/">Optimizely's developer documentation</a> and also used on <a href="http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/">Tocbot's webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Tocbot was featured in JS Weekly issue #283 and HTML Weekly (now Frontend Focus) issue #239 which was awesome. You can still read them <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/issues/283">here</a> and <a href="http://frontendfocus.co/issues/239">here</a> (respectively).</p>

<p>Note: These are both run by the same guy, Peter Cooper. Check out <a href="http://peterc.org/">his website</a> and subscribe to the above newsletters if you are interested in web development.</p>
<p>Tocbot has 122 stars as of 12/27/2016. I am glad that it provides simple but useful functionality without needing a lot of dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="serverless-s3-crud"><a href="#serverless-s3-crud" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Serverless S3 crud</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud">Serverless-s3-crud</a> is my most recent project, it was first started on 11/15/2016. It is a service meant to be used with <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a> and now it is currently listed as the third service in the <a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless#services-v10">services section of their README</a>. It does exactly what you would expect, it provides a serverless crud REST API for interacting with S3. There was already a <a href="https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-crud">serverless-crud</a> project which is similar but backed by Dynamo DB instead. I definitely plan to make use of this in future projects and I hope other people find it useful as well.</p>
