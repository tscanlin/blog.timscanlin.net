The projects are called <a href=\"http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/\">Tocbot</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud\">serverless-s3-crud</a>, try to guess what they do and read below to hear more about them. Hopefully people find them useful and build cool stuff with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tocbot\"><a href=\"#tocbot\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Tocbot</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/\">Tocbot</a> was first created on 3/22/2016. The idea for it came to me when I wanted a table of contents with jump links for navigating long pages with a lot of text. I found a library called <a href=\"http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js/\">Tocify</a> that worked and basically did what I wanted, but I didn't like that it had dependencies on jQuery AND jQuery UI which are huge, and it was also no longer actively maintained; so I decided to write my own library with no jQuery dependencies that used native DOM methods instead. The result is Tocbot, which is currently used on <a href=\"https://developers.optimizely.com/x/solutions/javascript/reference/\">Optimizely's developer documentation</a> and also used on <a href=\"http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/\">Tocbot's webpage</a>.</p>\n<p>Tocbot was featured in JS Weekly issue #283 and HTML Weekly (now Frontend Focus) issue #239 which was awesome. You can still read them <a href=\"http://javascriptweekly.com/issues/283\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://frontendfocus.co/issues/239\">here</a> (respectively).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/tocbot-js-weekly-283-highlighted.png\" alt=\"tocbot js weekly\">\n<em>JS Weekly</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/tocbot-html5-weekly-239-highlighted.png\" alt=\"tocbot html5 weekly\">\n<em>HTML5 Weekly</em></p>\n<p>Note: These are both run by the same guy, Peter Cooper. Check out <a href=\"http://peterc.org/\">his website</a> and subscribe to the above newsletters if you are interested in web development.</p>\n<p>Tocbot has 122 stars as of 12/27/2016. I am glad that it provides simple but useful functionality without needing a lot of dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"serverless-s3-crud\"><a href=\"#serverless-s3-crud\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Serverless S3 crud</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud\">Serverless-s3-crud</a> is my most recent project, it was first started on 11/15/2016. It is a service meant to be used with <a href=\"https://serverless.com/\">Serverless</a> and now it is currently listed as the third service in the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless#services-v10\">services section of their README</a>. It does exactly what you would expect, it provides a serverless crud REST API for interacting with S3. There was already a <a href=\"https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-crud\">serverless-crud</a> project which is similar but backed by Dynamo DB instead. I definitely plan to make use of this in future projects and I hope other people find it useful as well.</p>\n<p>Go check out <a href=\"http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/\">Tocbot</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud\">serverless-s3-crud</a> if you haven't already and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tim_scanlin\">tweet @ me</a> or open an issue on github if you have any feedback.</p>\n","__filename":"posts/2016/open-source-projects-in-2016.md","__url":"/posts/2016/open-source-projects-in-2016/","__resourceUrl":"/posts/2016/open-source-projects-in-2016/index.html","__dataUrl":"/posts/2016/open-source-projects-in-2016/index.html.c915b9f1fb6fc856dc2d174a3445d5f0.json"}
